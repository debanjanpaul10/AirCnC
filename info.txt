The media query can be added to the single CSS file by making it as the syntax --->

@media only screen and (min-width: <size>px) {
    codes
}

the above code means that when we hit greater than <size>px add the extra codes. Else, don't.
Most useful for mobile site approach.

If the desktop site approach is used, the syntax becomes --->

@media only screen and (max-width: <size>px) {
    codes
}

the above code means that when we become less that <size>px add the extra codes. Else, don't.

Add clearfix command with float-clear type situations to ease the clear part
Syntax --->
<div class="clearfix <classname>">
codes
</div>

to the CSS add-->

    .clearfix:after {
        content: "";
        display: table;
        clear: both;    
    }

Two classes can be added to a single div/section/aside tag using the syntax --->

    <div class ="class_1 class_2"> ....</div>
